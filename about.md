This is the personal blog of St√©phan Tulkens.

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [Dataprovider.com](https://www.dataprovider.com). I work on a variety of AI projects, mostly to do with Information Retrieval-like tasks.

Before that, I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Slimmer A.I.](https://www.slimmer.ai). I specifically focused on  analyzing scientific text within the publishing process.

Previously, I was a ph.d student at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be), the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics Research Center at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. My thesis topic was on the psycholinguistics of lexical access and word recognition. I defended my thesis remotely on the 11th of September 2020.

Previously, I also held a researcher position at CLiPS, where I worked on extracting concepts from free text clinical records in the scope of the [Accumulate](http://www.accumulate.be) project.

I enjoy most things related to programming. My programming language of choice is Python (3.x). I also like reading and listening to jazz music. My favorite author is Jeff Vandermeer, my favorite musical artist changes frequently.
