Hi! :wave:, I'm St√©phan. I am a Machine Learning engineer/NLP Person. Welcome to my personal website. I hope you enjoy reading it. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out through my social channels, or via [e-mail](stephan.tul+github@gmail.com).

## Personal

* I live in Antwerp, but I used to live in the far north of the Netherlands, in Groningen.
* I am the father of twins, a boy and a girl, they're about 2 years old now. Having twins is super tough, I like to think I did a lot of tough things in my life, but really, nothing compares to raising two strong-willed children of the same age.
* I enjoy reading books. My favorite author is Jeff Vandermeer. I really tend to enjoy what people call "weird fiction", although I think the term is a bit overused, and tends to gravitate towards Lovecraft worship.
* I am an avid music listener. I really like focused listening to new music, and the act of conciously listening to a new album or piece of music. I tend to "overlisten" to a single album, only to then discard it soon after, in mild disgust that I would ever listen to such drivel.
* I studied philosophy (BA), software engineering (BA), and (computational) linguistics (MA & PhD).
* Am a bit of a luddite, not by choice, but it's the way I am.
* I believe doing nothing sometimes is super useful. Try doing more nothing!

## Jobs

I am currently working as a Senior NLP/Machine Learning Engineer at [Metamaze](https://www.metamaze.eu). I work on a lot of projects related to generative AI, mostly related to the core business of Metamaze, which is automated document processing.

Before that, I worked as a Data Scientist at [Dataprovider.com](https://www.dataprovider.com). I work on a variety of AI projects, mostly to do with Information Retrieval-like tasks.

Even longer ago, a machine learning engineer at [Slimmer A.I.](https://www.slimmer.ai). I specifically focused on  analyzing scientific text within the publishing process.

And a very long time ago, I was a ph.d student at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be), the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics Research Center at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. My thesis topic was on the psycholinguistics of lexical access and word recognition. I defended my thesis remotely on the 11th of September 2020.

Even much longer ago, I also held a researcher position at CLiPS, where I worked on extracting concepts from free text clinical records in the scope of the [Accumulate](http://www.accumulate.be) project.
