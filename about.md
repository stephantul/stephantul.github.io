This is the personal blog of St√©phan Tulkens. I am currently a ph.d student at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be), the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics Research Center at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. I am currently funded through the Flemish FWO to work on computational models of semantics in bilingualism, using machine learning methods. I do this under the watchful supervision of Professors [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/~walter/) and [Dominiek Sandra](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/people/dominiek-sandra).

Previously, I also held a researcher position at CLiPS, where I worked on extracting concepts from free text clinical records in the scope of the [Accumulate](http://www.accumulate.be) project.

I am interested in things related to semantics, specifically in the definition of word meaning, and how this influences our conception of semantics in computational models.

Another thing I like thinking about is the notion of representation, and how it is used in Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics.

I enjoy all things programming, except web-design. My programming language of choice is Python (3.x).
