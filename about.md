This is the personal blog of St√©phan Tulkens. I am currently a ph.d student at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be), the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics Research Center at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. I am currently funded through the Flemish FWO to work on computational models of semantics in bilingualism, using machine learning methods. I do this under the watchful supervision of Professors [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/~walter/) and [Dominiek Sandra](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/people/dominiek-sandra).

Previously, I also held a researcher position at CLiPS, where I worked on extracting concepts from free text clinical records in the scope of the [Accumulate](http://www.accumulate.be) project.

I am interested in things related to semantics, specifically in the definition of word meaning, and how this influences our conception of semantics in computational models.

Another thing I like thinking about is the notion of representation, how it is used in Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics, and how the use of this concept differs from the way it is used in philosophy.

I enjoy all things programming, except web-design. My programming language of choice is Python (3.x).

On the machine learning side, I enjoy using neural networks, specifically unsupervised neural networks such as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs).
