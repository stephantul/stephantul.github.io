Ph.D Candidate at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be) under the supervision of [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/walter-daelemans) and [Dominiek Sandra](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/people/dominiek-sandra)

I am currently studying the computational modeling of Bilingual word reading in sentence context.

Before that (until Oct 2016), I worked on biomedical and clinical text representation.
