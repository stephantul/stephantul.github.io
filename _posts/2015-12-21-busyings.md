Currently Ph.D Candidate on the Accumulate project at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be) under the supervision of [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/walter-daelemans).

In the scope of the Accumulate project I will work on clinical text mining but I am interested in a lot of other things.
